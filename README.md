Web 3.0 is the third era of internet providers for sites and applications that will zero in on utilizing a machine-based comprehension of information to give an information driven and semantic web. A definitive objective of Web 3.0 is to make more smart, associated and open sites.  

Web 3.0 has not yet been actualized, so there is no strong definition. It took more than ten years to progress from the first web, Web 1.0, to Web 2.0, and it is required to take similarly as long, if not longer, to completely execute and reshape the web with Web 3.0. In any case, the advancements that a few people accept will make up and at last characterize Web 3.0 are as of now being created. Brilliant home machines utilizing remote organizations, the Internet of Things (IoT), cryptocurrency and NFT (Non-Fungible Token) with blockchain technology to bring value to the virtual items, are some instances of how Web 3.0 is now affecting innovation.  

On the off chance that the pattern of progress is followed from Web 1.0, a static data supplier where individuals read sites yet infrequently communicated with them, to Web 2.0, an intuitive and social web empowering coordinated effort between clients, at that point it very well may be expected that Web 3.0 will change both how sites are made and how individuals interface with them You have presumably heard the expression “web 3.0” gliding around the web.

PC researchers and Internet specialists accept that these progressions will make the web more intelligent and our lives simpler. In this way, to comprehend these outlook changing changes, we should initially take a gander at the development of the web as we probably am aware it.  

These are 5 Properties of Web 3.0 

To comprehend the subtleties and nuances of Web 3.0, we should take a gander at the five properties of Web 3.0: 

Blockchain
